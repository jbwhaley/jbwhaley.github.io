I'm considering the idea of adding a lifetime subscription option to [LinkLocker](https://linklocker.co). I think "subscription fatigue" is a very real phenomenon, and I personally understand where that feeling is coming from. I think I can set a price for lifetime access that will work from a business perspective, and I'm seriously considering this. I'm curious about what users of online services might think about such a model.
