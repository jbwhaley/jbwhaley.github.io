I am currently using [News Explorer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/news-explorer/id1032668306?mt=8) for reading feeds. There are clients for both iOS and Mac, and they are improving all the time. What I like most about it is that it syncs over iCloud rather than via some third party service. It works really well, and I don't have to depend on some service to continue existing forever. I keep the data in my own little iCloud silo.
