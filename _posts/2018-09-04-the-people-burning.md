The people [burning their shoes](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2018/09/04/people-are-destroying-their-nike-gear-protest-colin-kaepernicks-just-do-it-campaign/) in objection to Nike's Colin Kaepernick ads realize that they're only destroying their own property, right? They understand that Nike has already received the money for those shoes, don't they?
