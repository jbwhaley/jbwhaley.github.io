Amazon's delivery options are increasingly [bizarre](https://www.amazon.com/b/ref=key_pola_gw_prime_hero?ie=UTF8&node=17051031011&pf_rd_p=4faf2b8c-c587-4525-b781-ecb2e259542e&pf_rd_r=X64GB19HH5MV1VPE0Z4Z). I don't understand how the concept of asking customers to let delivery drivers enter their homes and cars ever got past the smell-test stage.
