*Ars* [reports that New York City is pushing to study the ways in which the city's digital algorithms might be discriminatory toward the city's people](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2017/12/new-york-city-moves-to-create-accountability-for-algorithms/). I hope more jurisdictions will begin looking into this issue, which has subtle but powerful effects on all of our lives.
