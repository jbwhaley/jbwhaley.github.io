[Uber's decision to pay the ransom was stupid](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hacked-companies-like-uber-not-pay-ransoms-200811674.html) not just for the reasons enumerated in this articleâ€”it was also stupid because it's money down a hole. How would anyone be able to verify that the attackers destroyed the data? What keeps them from hanging onto it, exactly? Utterly moronic.
