Our Dear Leader, The Dishonorable Resident Dump, has ordered Google to [do more to let stupid people read](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/08/trump-claims-with-no-evidence-that-google-is-rigged-against-him/) stupid bovine excrement, written by stupid bovines (presumably with their hooves). The move is largely seen as a token gesture toward the powerful Stupid People lobby, given the fact that Stupid People can't read words.

Several non-dumb people familiar with the matter placed their palms upon their faces, looked down at the ground, wept, and prayed for Bob Mueller to *Bring The Ruckus Al-Freaking-Ready*.
