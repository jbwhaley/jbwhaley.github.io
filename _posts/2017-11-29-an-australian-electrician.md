An Australian electrician discovered that he could [keep his employer from creepily tracking his location by putting his mobile device in a mylar snack bag](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/11/australian-man-uses-snack-bags-as-faraday-cage-to-block-tracking-by-employer/), using the bag as a Faraday cage to block GPS signals. Congratulations to you, sir.
