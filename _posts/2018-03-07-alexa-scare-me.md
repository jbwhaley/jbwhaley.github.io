[*Buzzfeed* is reporting](https://www.buzzfeed.com/venessawong/amazon-alexa-devices-are-laughing-creepy) that some users of Amazon’s Echo devices are feeling a bit creeped out at the fact that Alexa—a piece of *software* running on a cheap, crappy speaker—is “laughing" at them:

> One person who was on the verge of falling into a peaceful slumber described hearing a "very loud and creepy laugh" from his Echo Dot. "There's a good chance I get murdered tonight," he tweeted.

It's *amazing* what people will willingly do to themselves, their families, and their own sanity simply because it’s somehow gotten too difficult to touch a phone.
