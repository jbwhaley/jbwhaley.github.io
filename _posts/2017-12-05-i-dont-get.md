I must be quite alone in almost never watching things on YouTube. Maybe once per month, for about three minutes. I am never in a situation where watching video is appropriate, except at night when my TV is in front of meâ€”and there's so much to watch there, why would I want to watch a bunch of randos shooting bad video on their phones with terrible audio? 

Maybe I'm just old. I mean, I am *definitely* old, but maybe the oldness explains my mystification with the phenomenon of YouTube as an only source of moving images.
