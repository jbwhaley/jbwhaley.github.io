[Dick Durbin's quip to Mark Zuckerberg](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/technology/2018/04/10/b72c09e8-3d03-11e8-974f-aacd97698cef_story.html?noredirect=on&utm_term=.75a41339b504) is a bit sardonic and maybe even juvenile, but it's hard not to chuckle in agreement:

> Another pointed exchange took place when Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) asked Zuckerberg what hotel he stayed at Monday night and the names of anyone he messaged this week. Zuckerberg, appearing amused by the question, declined to answer.

The silence speaks volumes.
