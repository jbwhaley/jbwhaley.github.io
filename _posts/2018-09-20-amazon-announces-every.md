I continue to be baffled, personally, by [the rise of all this talking-furniture crap](https://gizmodo.com/amazon-is-going-to-drown-us-in-alexa-crap-1829202572):

> Amazon proceeded to announce a new $60 Amazon Basics Microwave, which of course, has Alexa built in. Yes, you still have to put the popcorn in the box yourself, but if you’re too lazy to hit one button, you can ask Alexa to get the popping started.

If I am standing at the microwave already—*to put the food in it*—why in this or any other world would it be easier, better, etc. to talk to the thing rather than simply to tap a few buttons? 

What is wrong with people?
