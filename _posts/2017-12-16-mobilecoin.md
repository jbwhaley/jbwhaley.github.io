Moxie Marlinspike's and Joshua Goldbard's proposed [MobileCoin cryptocurrency](https://www.wired.com/story/mobilecoin-cryptocurrency/) has a lot of potential; in effect, it stores the blockchain in an SGX enclave on a user's processor. This arrangement is more secure, more anonymous, and more user-friendly than public-blockchain cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin. I'm intrigued.
