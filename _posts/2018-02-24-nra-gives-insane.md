The mind boggles at the thought that anyone could seriously [believe that Ajit Pai "saved the Internet" and our "free speech rights" by overturning rules meant to protect the free flow of ideas from corporate intervention](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2018/02/nra-gives-ajit-pai-courage-award-and-gun-for-saving-the-internet).
