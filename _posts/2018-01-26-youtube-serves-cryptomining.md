Ads can be much more than an annoyance. Sometimes they provide a handy window for attackers to get into your computer, [even on sites you think you can trust](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/01/now-even-youtube-serves-ads-with-cpu-draining-cryptocurrency-miners/). Stop contributing to the online advertising economy: find indie sites that provide a useful service, and pay them for that service.
