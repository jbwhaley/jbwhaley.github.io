"Someone" submitted a million fake comments to the FCC which appear to favor their push to upend Net Neutrality. They may even have posted such a comment under **your** name. [Comcastroturf](https://www.comcastroturf.com) will help you search the FCC's site for comments fraudulently posted on your behalf.
