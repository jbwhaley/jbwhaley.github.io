[This story](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/11/22/official-says-hes-been-stymied-by-the-fcc-in-investigation-of-fake-net-neutrality-foes/) is particularly rich, after [yesterday's story](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16689838/fcc-net-neutrality-comments-were-largely-ignored) about their throwing out comments that didn't make a "serious legal argument." It's amazing that they think they can (and may!) get away with this.
