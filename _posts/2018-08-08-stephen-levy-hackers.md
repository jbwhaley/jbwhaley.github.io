Stephen Levy, *[Hackers](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackers:_Heroes_of_the_Computer_Revolution)*:

> [...] hackers generally hate driving cars-the system of randomly programmed red lights and oddly laid out one-way streets causes delays which are so goddamn *unnecessary* that the impulse is to rearrange signs, open up traffic-light control boxes...redesign the entire system.
