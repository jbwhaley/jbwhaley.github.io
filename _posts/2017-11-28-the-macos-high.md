[The MacOs High Sierra root account bug](https://9to5mac.com/2017/11/28/how-to-set-root-password/) is indeed serious, and it is indeed due to a really amazingly dumb failure in Apple's QC checks. Bear in mind that the threat model entails physical access to the machine, and that there is a workaround in enabling a root account and giving it a decent password. For many users, there may not be much to worry about, and Apple will certainly issue a fix soon. Still, this is a *really* dumb bug.
