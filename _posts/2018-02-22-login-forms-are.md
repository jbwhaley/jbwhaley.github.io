There are (at least) two really annoying login approaches I'm seeing everywhere on the Web these days:

1. Not putting a login form on the index page, opting for a signup form instead;
2. Not displaying the password field until after a username has been entered.

The first one is largely due to lame "growth-hacking." The second is a lame response to the rise in malicious login attempts I noted in my post last night.

We cannot have nice things.
