I'm the guest wiseass-in-residence on [the latest episode of *Stan Tbe Obscurities*](https://soundcloud.com/hungerist/domino-principle), a new film criticism podcast hosted by my old friends Alejandro Adams and Sara Vizcarrondo. We dive into the tiny microgenre of 1970's political thrillers, with a particular focus on trying to convince you *not* to watch Stanley Kramer's *The Domino Principle*. It's [on Amazon Prime Video](https://www.amazon.com/Domino-Principle-Gene-Hackman/dp/B07CT8PNWJ/ref=mp_s_a_1_1/141-6947370-1453007?ie=UTF8&qid=1541284372&sr=8-1&pi=PI_PJPrime-Sash-Extra-Large-2017,TopLeft,0,0_AC_SX118_SY170_QL70&keywords=the+domino+principle&dpPl=1&dpID=41SYGgdIdnL&ref=plSrch), if you wish to defy us and watch it.

Which you should totally do if you're a fan of unchecked paranoia, bad wigs, or Mickey Rooney's nipple hair. Yes, that's right.

Either way, I think you'll enjoy our discussion. It's a great listen whether you defy us and watch the film or not.
