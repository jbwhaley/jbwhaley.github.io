These are a few open-source scripts and projects I have built. Feel free to contact me if you encounter any issues while using them, or if you have suggestions about how they might be improved.

* [Microblogger](https://github.com/jbwhaley/MicroBlogger) is a workflow for Alfred 3 which facilitates easy posting to Micro.blog sites from an Alfred prompt.
	* The related [MicroBlogger.py](https://gist.github.com/jbwhaley/126ddcd807bf5ff95909a78d863e1e6d) is a standalone Python script written for use on iOS with Pythonista and Drafts, but it can be easily adapted for other purposes.
