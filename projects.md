## LinkLocker

I am the founder and sole developer at [LinkLocker](https://linklocker.co), a subscription-based, privacy-centric bookmarking service. There are no social features at all, and the entire site was built from the ground up with respect for your privacy in mind. Currently the service is Web-only (with a [REST API](https://linklocker.co/api)), but we hope to release our iOS app relatively soon.

## PootiePets

[PootiePets](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pootiepets/id1259596278?mt=8) is a goofy iOS sticker pack I made. It consists of a bunch of drawings of farting animals. 

## RandoRando

[RandoRando](http://randorando.com) is a truly-random number generator based on the [random.org](http://random.org) API. I built it a few years ago while learning to build Web apps with Python and Flask, and every now and then I find it to be a handy little tool.

## Micro.blog related

* [Microblogger](https://github.com/jbwhaley/MicroBlogger) is a workflow for Alfred 3 which facilitates easy posting to Micro.blog sites from an Alfred prompt.
	* The related [MicroBlogger.py](https://gist.github.com/jbwhaley/126ddcd807bf5ff95909a78d863e1e6d) is a standalone Python script written for use on iOS with Pythonista and Drafts, but it can be easily adapted for other purposes.
