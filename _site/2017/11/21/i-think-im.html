Probably a good idea to change the root password on all Macs ASAP.

Bear in mind that the threat model entails physical access to the machine, and that there is a workaround in enabling a root account and giving it a decent password. For many users, there may not be much to worry about, and Apple will certainly issue a fix soon. Still, this is a *really* dumb bug.
