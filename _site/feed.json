			"content_html": "<p>I am currently using <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/news-explorer/id1032668306?mt=8\">News Explorer</a> for reading feeds. There are clients for both iOS and Mac, and they are improving all the time. What I like most about it is that it syncs over iCloud rather than via some third party service. It works really well, and I don’t have to depend on some service to continue existing forever. I keep the data in my own little iCloud silo.</p>\n",

I’m curious about what users of online services might think about such a model. </p>\n",
