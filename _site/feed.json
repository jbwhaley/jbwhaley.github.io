			"content_html": "<p>I’m considering the idea of adding a lifetime subscription option to <a href=\"https://linklocker.co\">LinkLocker</a>. I think “subscription fatigue” is a very real phenomenon, and I personally understand where that feeling is coming from. I think I can set a price for lifetime access that will work from a business perspective, and I’m seriously considering this. I’m curious about what users of online services might think about such a model. </p>\n",
