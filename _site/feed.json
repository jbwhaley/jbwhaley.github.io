I am never in a situation where watching video is appropriate, except at night when my TV is in front of me—and there’s so much to watch there, why would I want to watch a bunch of randos shooting bad video on their phones with terrible audio? </p>\n\n<p>Maybe I’m just old. I mean, I am <em>definitely</em> old, but maybe the oldness explains my mystification with the phenomenon of YouTube as an only source of moving images. </p>\n",
