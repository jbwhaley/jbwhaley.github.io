The move is largely seen as a token gesture toward the powerful Stupid People lobby, given the fact that Stupid People can’t read words.</p>\n\n<p>Several non-dumb people familiar with the matter placed their palms upon their faces, looked down at the ground, wept, and prayed for Bob Mueller to <em>Bring The Ruckus Al-Freaking-Ready</em>.</p>\n",
